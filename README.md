# ESP32-drives-a-RGBW-Strip
Connect ESP32 and an RGBW strip with sk6812

Using Pin32 as the LED bus Pin. This repro is build around the adafruit neopixel library, using a modified
example that library.

I use this to test the led-strip, or only parts of a strip. Even a single led will work.
Right now it is set to drive 40 LED's.
